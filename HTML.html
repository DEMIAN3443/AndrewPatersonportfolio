        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In embarking on the INNOSTRAT course, my enthusiasm was piqued by the unique opportunity to engage directly with real companies, addressing tangible challenges maybe increase my knowledge within the landscape of global supply chain management as it is my master's and field og interest.While this isn't what I necessarily got, this course taught me far more. Through unprecedented dive into practical applications of theory, literally through hands-on experiences. As we navigated through the complexities of real-world business scenarios, my aspiration was not just to learn but to contribute meaningful solutions that reflect a deep understanding of strategic, innovative, entrepreneurial, and sustainable principles. The group I was part of was working with "PITCH" a platform that I surprisingly did not know about.

        <h2>Learning Journey Timeline</h2>
        <p>One of the early transformative experiences in the course involved hands-on team exercises designed to foster innovation from the ground up. Among these, the practice of comparing sticky notes on a wall stands out as a vibrant brainstorming method that led us to uncover diverse perspectives and ideas. This simple yet effective approach laid the groundwork for our deeper engagement with design thinking principles.
        Another significant milestone was our venture into building LO-FI prototypes. This task challenged us to distill our understanding of customer needs into tangible product concepts, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Through these exercises, we not only honed our skills in empathetic design and customer-centric innovation but also learned the value of collaboration in crafting solutions that could truly resonate in the marketplace.
        These moments were pivotal, marking my transition from a passive learner to an active participant in the innovation process. They were the first of many steps in a journey that profoundly shaped my approach to problem-solving and product development/innovation.</p>

        <h2>Course Reflections</h2>
        <p>Throughout the course, one of the most significant challenges I encountered was transitioning from a structured academic environment, where directions are clearly provided, to a more open-ended format that encouraged personal initiative and creative thinking. This shift was both daunting and exhilarating, as it pushed me to explore my problem-solving capabilities without a predefined roadmap. The real turning point came when I learned to embrace this ambiguity, realizing that innovation often begins with uncertainty.
        A particular session that profoundly impacted my approach was when we delved into design thinking and customer-centric innovation. This module did not just offer tools and techniques but fundamentally changed my perspective on how solutions should be ideated and developed. It taught me that starting from the customer's needs and working backward could provide a clear direction even in the most open-ended scenarios.
        This challenge, paired with the insights gained from the course, has equipped me with a newfound confidence in navigating the complexities of the business world. It has taught me that the path to innovation is not always linear, and embracing the unknown is a critical step in developing groundbreaking solutions.
    In fact at the end of the course when we presented our work for "PITCH" members, the feedback we got wasn't what I wanted to hear. If we would've had another exchange with the staff maybe we could have ameliorated our strategy and strenghtened our standpoint a bit more. In the end, communication is key.</p>

        <h2>Showcased Works</h2>
        <p>A pivotal project that showcases my skills and understanding acquired from the course involved the extensive use of business model canvases to evaluate different market segments for our potential venture.By systematically analyzing various aspects of each business model, such as value propositions, customer segments, and revenue streams, we were able to discern which market segment presented the most attractive opportunity for innovation and growth.
        This project exemplified the importance of adopting a structured approach to decision-making, emphasizing that such methodologies are not confined to business contexts alone but are applicable to personal and professional decisions alike. It reflected significant growth in my ability to navigate complex information, make informed choices, and understand the broader implications of those choices in a real-world context.</p>

        <h2>Skills & Competencies Matrix</h2>
        <p>Instead of using a random template let me tell you in my own words about my different self after 5 months of this course. 
        The skill I've honed most profoundly is the ability to think innovativelyâ€”venturing beyond traditional boundaries to seek unique solutions. This was especially illuminated as we applied the Red and Blue Ocean strategies, analyzing and creating business models that not only compete in existing markets but also create new, uncontested spaces. This conceptual framework encouraged me not to just compete within crowded marketplaces (Red Oceans) but to create new markets (Blue Oceans) where competition might not even be existent yet.
        This approach has profoundly shifted my strategic thinking, providing me with the confidence to explore unconventional paths in both my academic projects and future professional endeavors. The competence in differentiating between when to compete and when to create has become an invaluable asset, guiding my decisions towards more innovative, sustainable, and impactful outcomes..</p>

    <section id="reflective-essays">
        <h2>Reflective Essays</h2>
        <p>In a particularly insightful exercise, our team's business proposal, developed with 'Pitch' as the focal product offering, was compared and contrasted with another team's project. This peer review session was invaluable, offering a fresh perspective on our approach and its feasibility in the real world. The feedback we received was a blend of constructive criticism and encouragement, highlighting areas for refinement while affirming the innovative aspects of our proposal.
        This experience reinforced the importance of external feedback in the innovation process, providing a reality check on our ideas' practicality and market fit. It underscored the value of looking beyond our team's assumptions, embracing diverse viewpoints to refine and strengthen our business model. The exercise was a clear testament to the course's emphasis on collaboration, critical thinking, and the willingness to pivot based on insightful feedback. Reflecting on this, I've gained not just skills in innovative thinking but also in actively seeking and incorporating feedback to enhance strategic decisions as you get the chance to accept critique and become a better person, find below a feedback i was able to get from one of my fellow teammates (they should be more but that's all the responsiveness i could get).

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        I know this porfolio seems like an essay but that's just the way I like to express myself. To sum up, this course was a delightful experience. We forget most of what we learn at Uni in the span of a year after graduating. However the things we did in this course will surely stay in my memory for quite longer. And I will always remember to think innovatively and never settle, there's always room for improvement.
